# On Diagramming Options

saw this for the first time yesterday (behind on the curve), but looks very, very promising: **D2: Declarative Diagramming** https://github.com/terrastruct/d2

i'm a huge fan of diagramming tools, including graphviz, mermaid, plantuml, etc, but this is a new one

it's a freemium model where the 'core' is open-source and free, but we'll pay for extra features

and bonus points for being written in Go!

it doesn't have the same markdown/browser integration as mermaid (yet)

but it does have auto-rebuild from the cli, and could probably be easily workflow-integrated with something like: https://marked2app.com/ (for mac)

note that the *marked* app is purely a markdown viewer, and is meant to be paired alongside whatever text editor you use, and has swappable/customizable markdown engines depending on your platform & theming

in practice, it means you can use say vim to edit, but see marked refresh your document preview in another window

and it does a better job than say the preview panes in vscode or jetbrains

for future reference for others, another go-to of mine is to export to a nodes list and an edges list, then import those into 2 excel tabs of all things (although xml/ged works too), then using the free version of: https://www.yworks.com/products/yed  you can import this list and use its layout engine, but also then allows you to group things and collapse/expand these groups, and interactively drag & move things and explore the workspace

^ useful for having a mix of auto layout and custom layout then taking screenshots

it pains me that https://www.graphistry.com/ exists, because *i want to try it so badly* but it's a cloud service and requires sending data remotely, and i'd have to get agreement from customers/management/etc to do it

re: D2, here's the hackernews link from yesterday where it came up, but has some interesting discussions: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33704254

https://www.ilograph.com/ looks pretty interesting too, for interactivity - and supports both web & desktop

i really want to use ilograph but it's fairly expensive at $11USD/month, and i just can't stomach losing access to my own work, and i can't send info to (another) cloud with jumping through lots of hoops

i've grown quite fond of:  Edraw by Wondershare: https://www.edrawsoft.com/

it's cross-platform: windows+mac+linux,  it's not that expensive compared to other manual diagramming tools, you keep the software after purchase, it produces SVG's, has Visio support, and layers, importable/custom shapes, and it's fast & easy to use
