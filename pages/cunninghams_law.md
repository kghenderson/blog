# Cunningham's law - fear of a blank page

**Cunningham's Law** : https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham's_Law , i.e.: "the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer."

Also reminds me of Book: The War of Art and the Invocation of the Muse.

with regards to content and how it becomes actionable, is that some content is curated for 'correctness' and that is valid, but if you have ways to capture what people are *actually doing* in a safe way, then it's much easier for others to come along and propose alternatives and gotchas

staring at a blank page is much harder than commenting on what you see, and not having to worry about whether your answer is official or perfectly "right" and that peer review can help sort it out
