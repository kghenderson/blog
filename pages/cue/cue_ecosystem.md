# Cue as an ecosystem

not going to fully expand this here, but i think i share the view of cue as being a meta-language/coordinator of other languages and tools ...

so hooks and transforms between these tools and communities need to be first class so that it help tie these things together and deal with things like multi-user, and multi-scenario, streams & data flow,  schema/definition/language generations/transpiling, etc. etc. (anyway, more on this later)
