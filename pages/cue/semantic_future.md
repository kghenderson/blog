i hadn't seen this article until today, but it resonates so well, for my own opinions and for cue

key quotes:

> Already most of those using JSON in anger in industry are focusing on [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/). This solves the easy problems for trees, but not the problems for graphs. It also doesn't solve the problem of describing the meaning of data, or give any help with inference or calculation.What we need is a [Literate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) Type Theory for JSON, which allows us to specify typed references, giving us the power of graphs, but the simplicity of JSON at the same time.

> I've [sic] been working to try out some of these ideas at [TerminusDB](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb) (stars welcome), but for this to work it needs to be a standard which is widely shared. And for that reason we need a standard. We need a movement to revitalise the Semantic Web with *ideas* that primarily serve to *do work*.Luckily, there is renewed interest in Semantic Web-like ideas in industry, but industry is not looking to the Semantic Web or to academia to solve them. It's looking to find them in the ideas of the [Data Mesh](https://www.datamesh-architecture.com/).
