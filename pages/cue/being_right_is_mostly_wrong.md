# Being disproportionately wrong / right is mostly wrong

the gist of this topic is that developer's in particular, but many, often get 'imposter syndrome' where they think everyone else knows what they're doing except for themselves ... which is of course just a *fallacy* and not true, but i think there's a relationship to cue here as well

essentially, when you're climbing a mountain and looking up the mountain, you tend to forget how far you've already climbed ... (obviously this is just a metaphor, but it applies both to developers learning more and getting better at their jobs, and to developers or really anyone who's building a system of ever-increasing and building complexity)

any and every system begins small with a hello world and then the complexity grows

hmm, since there's two analogues to the analogy i just brought up, maybe ... start with *people* first, i.e. developers learning and increasing their skills, like many future cue users ...

we take for granted the fact that to install cue in the first place (locally, playground is even easier), but let's take the case of a mac ... you have to install homebrew, and know how to use a terminal & shell kinda, and you have to have and some text editor (hard stop on getting into this topic!) ...

okay, so you get this, and then your learn about data types, text vs numbers and collections (structs, lists, maps), ok, and you can spit out json

little steps, then maybe you try an imported function and generate a new field that references a different one ...

we can come back to the glide path, but each tiny level was its own struggle, and the following day, you just take those things for granted, and start working on the next problem

and as you're working through that problem, you just breeze right through those easy things and maybe smile a bit, but in your *mind* you're not thinking about the stuff you already *know* how to do, your mind is only focused on things *you don't understand*

and it's not that you're *stupid* (although many feel that way) because you've already climbed past all of those things, you're doing great! sometimes you have really excellent people in your lives who will remind you of this, but often times not ...

the point is, which i tell other developers, that every day you're learning something or doing something you haven't done before ... and learning is awesome in hindsight, but often when you're doing it, it suuuuucks ....

(not always, just saying: having to research how to do something, or brute-force experiment to just *why won't you work* *(code) ...* then you finally crack it - often you don't say to yourself 'great' you think 'finally' and it was so easy '... in retrospect' ugh ... but then that problem is behind you, and now it's just onto that next problem

so, if you're doing things *right* (by always learning and progressing) then you're always *wrong* and experimenting and researching how to do something *you don't already know how to do* because if you did, it would be done and you wouldn't be thinking about it anymore ...

this really gets to people, but you have to learn to feel comfortable not knowing things, or just know how/where to most efficiently learn new things

for a quick cue recap: i'm going to split into another thread for how cue can help with this too, but i feel as a/the cue community, it's important that people don't get discouraged, and maybe even have something like 'belts' or levels where when you can address this level challenge you're a level 4 or blue belt or something

this isn't competitive and not for hiring/ranking, and it's actually important i think that it *never* becomes that ... but it gives people, particularly quiet people, and introverts, and people doing things on their own, some of our favorite people, a way to know they've made progress in understanding, and that we actively help them learn and extend that understanding into other areas (unfortunately even things like makefiles and shell scripting and http requests which can be *daunting* to newcomers - tabs vs spaces? invisible whitespace?! (yes, but set your editor up this way and you can see them as different characters) ...
