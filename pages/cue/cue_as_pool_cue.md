# Cue as pool cue

not sure if it's intentional, but notice on the community call with the new logo, that it looks a bit like a pool cue head on

which sent my broken brain on a tangent of lining up shots, getting leverage, walking around the table and seeing things from different perspectives: above, sides, seeing obstacles, etc.

and how cool it would be for cue to do the math to finally master those bank shots

which, like any normal person, brought me to thinking about Donald Duck in Mathmagic Land: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdVRvYnqj6w

and: Elliptical Pool Table - Numberphile https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KHCuXN2F3I

and: Pool Live AR - AR for Billiards or Pool Games https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyzt6hajcVM

anyway, continuing to ramble: this reminded me of a condition, particularly in the case of donald duck's lesson, that you (or rather people smarter than you) know *what* to do, but you don't remember it, and you have to be able to action it yourself ... i.e. you watch the donald duck lesson and then very soon forget

how does this relate to cue?

glad you asked! (or haven't given up reading)

because with cue, those rules and lessons can be encoded  and leveraged, as also the larger ecosystem of tried & tested tools, if you can just state the outcome you want and apply the right constraints, then CUE provides something like that augmented reality to help guide you to do the right thing - and give you & your team a mental advantage

almost want to say like 'augmented reality for the mind' but that's doesn't sound quite right

steve jobs used to talk about 'a bicycle for the mind', but cue is more like a segway or self-driving/driving assisted car, where you can leverage the logic of others

anyway, i like how with cue (and with graphs/graph-databases) you can easily validate & translate and get different perspectives of data/data-ecosystems, to mold it how you'd like, and i liked the imagery of seeing the tip of the pool cue and then zooming out

like ... coding is practicing playing pool and you're only ever as good as yourself, but teach a system (i.e. with cue & cue/open data-community), you can be better than yourself
