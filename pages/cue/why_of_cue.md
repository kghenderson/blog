# ... why, the why of cue

so, what started as a what was going to be a simple ramble on why cue, i thought i'd collect some links first, and that kinda turned into a 2 day exercise (and wow, quite a roller coaster of emotions)

this list may be edited down and i've made a copy in preparation for removing some perhaps controversial or triggering topics (although i tried very hard to generally keep it apolitical).

while there are some semi-tech topics these links weren't meant to be technical (that's a whole separate and probably much longer list) ... but i did pick these for a reason and i'd like to talk *around* the subject and how exactly it relates to *cue*

... ... ... as someone with pretty significant adhd (as i'm sure anyone who reads any of this (sorry, btw), it's easy to chase down a rabbit hole or pull a thread, and remember the context of why you're doing something and knowing when is enough (a particular burden of mine) ...

due to this mental style (or lack thereof), it's often hard for me to communicate with (some) people

and due to these communications-type issues, i've had to give a lot of thought and attention to learning and communication and how to structure things in order to facilitate these communications

i've learned that i'm very right-brained and think asynchronously and in pictures and relationships which are hard to put into words and to a linear, follow-able sequence - but a lot of communities and business/educational cultures are geared around precisely that opposite (from me) style (edited)

i'm only mentioning this to say that when you're *in* one of those cultures it's hard to appreciate the other side, and likewise *art* style cultures, which are more right-brained have an equal challenge understanding the left-brained ones

for instance there was a talk by jill bolte taylor on her *stroke of insight* where she had a unique realization of this. my own realization was my senior year of high school and reading a book called 'drawing on the right side of the brain'

there's a cable in the centre of our brains called the [corpus callosum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_callosum) which connects our two hemispheres and lets them work together, a communication cable ... so it's not really one side *or* the other, but both working together, however, depending on the context of your state of mind and what you're doing and thinking about, one side is in the foreground and the other's in the background

there's a lot of fascinating information on this, and i recommend alan alda's documentary on this (via pbs i believe)

and also the follow up from rsa animate on the divided brain, and the corpus callosum's role in not only allowing this communication but also *inhibiting* the communication between hemispheres (edited)

anyway, i'm always on the lookout and pay dear attention and have extreme gratitude to those people and friends in my life who act as bridges for me .... those very left brained folks who somehow have the patience and kindness to help make meaningful sense and cross this communication chasm ... but more on that later

cue takeaway's from this bit, which i'll try to summarize as i go along are that: regardless of upbringing or cultural-socio-economic status, every human posesses both of these modalities whether they're cognizant or appreciative of it or not

due to evolutionary reasons, we've adapted, in each of us, certain abilities and strategies to tune-in on some things, and tune-out other things and also a purely mental ability to reason about things which aren't in front of us and form mental models (but those really can only work when one feels safe from predators or that system shuts down)

one such friend, who i was mentioning earlier, is a a true master in *plain speak*

when certain personalities as a plain question, they want a simple, plain answer in a way they understand

this is of course is 100% reasonable (and doubly so from their perspective) , but for some reason i often have a really hard problem with this because of all of the factors and considerations and possibilities and so on

he's the answer (or rather 1 contributing answer) to a problem that cue that has but maybe doesn't fully know it

i've asked for his help with cue, in making cue simple, and gradual and in explaining how and why it's special in plain speak (he's very smart though btw, this plain speak is a gift).

but needless to say, he asked me a very simple question (my weakness ofc), of what's so special about cue

of course as that point my brain exploded, but i said that while cue in it's current state isn't necessarily the reason to love it, the hope of cue and the work in the area of its domain ... *could be* the most important work i do in my lifetime

now ... those words did come out of my mouth when explaining it, and there are near infinite ways that that statement needs to be qualified: i have 2 awesome and amazing children, and family and friendships and so on, which are more important

also ... i played no part in the creation of cue and it's long history, i've given no talks, and have only created a few github tickets and rambled in this transitory slack channel where these comments will disappear (although i do have a backup now, the point remains ... for cue to date i've thus far only played a trivial part ... so where do i get off on claiming its importance so profoundly?

i can't even say that i'm *good* at cue yet (i'm okay, but c'mon i've only been using it a few months) ... and there's still lots of issues with it (which are being worked on, it's part of growth) ... i know so little, how could i even *know* enough to even *claim* that it's worth pursuing?

many more sane people than me like to judge the qualification of statements being made, and objectively speaking, how could i even claim that cue is great if i'm new to it, it's not production ready (e.g. 1.0 yet), and on the surface it looks like yet another structured data thing of which there's a sea of options and besides, i've been making claims of AI-assisted code generation and we don't know what the future's going to look like anyway ... so again, why pay cue any attention, why spend time learning it if it's just going to be replaced or we have other tools which are "good enough"?

well ... i suppose "*because*" isn't quite a full or justifiable answer

of course, one of the great ironies/paradoxes is that i need is help *precisely* in helping to not only reduce the answer(s) into plain speak, but also to build a glide path help others with the "How" of cue in addition to the "Why" ... and hence the asynchronous link dump of far ranging and unannotated, undescribed links above ....

one of the great things that the book 'drawing on the right side of the brain' talks about is how the left-brain likes to label things ... so it can classify it ... then *set it aside* to keep zooming in on something else ... it's like a Zip file or symbolic link in the brain ... that you can say it's a 'tree' or a 'phone' or a 'friend' and quickly move on to other topics

so the book talks about removing labels because otherwise you dismiss all of the important information ... one of the exercises is to draw an object from a picture, such as teacup without thinking about it and you'll instead draw your generally draw your mental *symbol* of a teacup, and not what's actually there ... but flip the picture over and draw it upside down and you can't pattern-recognize it so now it's seemingly much, much harder because you're not drawing known shapes anymore, you actually have to look at it see the light and shadow - and this is really the key to making great art ... to seeing what's *really* there instead of your mental *pattern* for what's there ...

i found this as a teenager in my art, but also in my adult life doing data engineering and programming life that how people *think* things should work and how they *actually* work are often very different in this *same way* and that it's *extremely* challenging sometimes to get people to break this

(proceeds to smash head on desk)

but also still, similarly, for cue ... as soon as someone who has a mental model already for something ... as soon as they can grasp on and say: oh, it's just json without the quotes and commas, or oh ... it's just json schema .... or oh, it's like datalog ... or oh, it's just a weird-looking scripting language .... they'll file that away and never think about it again (unless you're just a code-monkey, like me, and just write it on your own for whatever purpose and no one else needs to actually care)

i've tried to describe cue in lots of different ways to lots of different people and generally it's falls under A: kevin's just crazy and he'll be over this phase and on to the next weird thing in a few months, and/or B: looks interesting - a human friendly json+schema to write other things with - sure, ok for now but someday we'll probably just replace it with something else more common in stack

ugh, so the why of cue is more than just describing it and there is HARD opposition all the way around

it's been said of me that i often take the path of ***most*** resistance and this is yet another case

so ... back to why cue, because it's goal (or my goal for it) is it's interoperability and its ability to support so many use cases and in subtle and particular ways (eventually), i.e. the community & sociological effects, which means lots of people and "Crossing the Chasm" but it's far from that today and each group already seems to have a *label* for one aspect of it where it risks being immediately dismissed, but they probably don't even recognize it's strength (well, maybe one of many) of being (mostly) the right thing for *all* of them ...

like a dunning-kruger of bias 
(terrible phrasing, but we'll work on that)

i'm reminded of that story (parable) of [the blind men and an elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant) ...

which, to save you the trouble of reading is that a group of blind men hear about an animal called an 'elephant' but none knows anything about them: so the first feels it from the front on its truck, and says it's like a snake, and the next feels its leg and says it's like a tree, and the next feels the side and says it's like a wall, and the last feels the tusk and says it's like a spear.

there's no punchline to this, just saying that the elephant is kind of all of those things, but also not at all what an elephant 'is'

cue is part markup language, part logic programming, part structured data 3.0, part graph database, part unix tool, part go library, etc., etc. ... but while that's true, the *confluence* of those things makes it more than the sum of its parts

all this text, and still not too much answer, and not in an easily relatable way (yet) on why cue

also troublesome is that due to those cognitive biases mentioned earlier, each group/individual needs a custom answer for what it means for *them* in practical terms ... plain speak is entirely *relative* to the group, each of which has all of its own history and baggage and language and needs and wants

even the default one stop 'elevator pitch' has an extremely biased and implicit bias ... who are you in the elevator *with*?

i think the implicit answer is "business" or a VC or Sales/Marketing person ...

which obviously would be geared around practical business value

this answer is *important* but so are the other values it brings, but a lot of other, important minds in the value chain wouldn't be interested it it because of this

for me personally, it's a legitimate and important component, but it's not what makes me passionate about it, it's not why i care ... to be frank there's probably other things i could study and learn to be personally more profitable

but the fact that it's business valuable and i can work on it professionally and earn a living (hopefully) while expanding and writing cue is *also* a differentiator from other purely academic things from which i can't

in the venn diagram of cue's importance, business viability to earn a living for my family is there as a necessary component ...

and let's be real, my career up to now has *not* involved cue but focused pretty squarely on the earning a living part, so in that venn diagram - from a reality component - that circle alone has won out

what makes me passionate i suppose is that the venn diagram of my side-interests and the business viable bubble align *better* than before (in a sense i'm getting paid to write cue now!) so it's like my passion interests and my professional needs have finally aligned or come closer to aligning - and now i'm putting all this energy into aligning them further (indirectly) and hopefully getting them to stay that way for a little while

reminds me of [the platypus playing the keytar](https://flowingdata.com/2011/10/28/venn-diagram-platypus-playing-a-keytar/)

anyway, i have to break now for today: but the why cue is a tough one than it might appear, my plain-speak friends are better at distilling these answers, cue is greater than the sum of it's parts, cue is not only business-viable and self-empowering professionally, but also aligns with other social virtues such as local+accessible own-your-own data, supporting the future (through data interoperability), education and gradual learning - glide path from hello world, supports order-independent expression so it can mold and be aligned with the languages and tools that different people needed, it's a nexus of open-source, structured data in a universal, transformable way, and can help us build guardrails and improve communication across all sorts of different communities which are worthy of support and protecting the future for our children and society ...

i'll keep coming back to these, but until i can competently explain to my friend why cue matters, i'm going to keep rambling on here and also making some beginner tutorials and glidepaths for the chasm-crossers and trying to lower the barriers to entry until right answers appear
