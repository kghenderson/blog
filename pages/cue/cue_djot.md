# Cue for literate programming: djot


https://github.com/jgm/djot

this isn't yet another markup language *cough* ... this is made as designed by john macfarlane, professor of philosophy (read: logic) from berkeley and the author of [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and [commonmark](https://commonmark.org/), 2 extremely important projects (edited)

it's specifically designed for structured text and to improve the objectivity and parsing time/complexity, so in my book, this is a big deal

pandoc is literally the universal translator of document formats and in directly alignment with the 'literate' future of cue

it works from pandoc as well, so that means it supports these: https://pandoc.org/diagram.svgz?v=20220825090929
