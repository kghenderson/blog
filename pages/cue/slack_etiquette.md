# Slack etiquette and setup recommendations

i know some people here are surely slack experts, but ... for docs and content, i think there should be a simple guide on slack setup (and etiquette)

there are many good etiquette/community examples out there already, but i'm making this post/thread to talk more about the setup for people new to the slack community and/or non-power users

specifically, i mean things like configuring your notification preferences and setting your *do not disturb* hours, and conveying the fact that even after setting those hours, people can still choose to override them, so you're not missing anything ...

some people think of slack (rightly) as like instant messenger where you say 'hey' and the person responds, and you have a realtime conversation ... and that's still a thing, but should be managed as such as a DM or special channel(s) for that purpose

another advantage of slack is that apart from signing up, it's extremely low friction ....and facilitates *out of band* communications

and as this community grows and attracts people around the world, and people on odd schedules (like tony and me), we don't want a reluctance to post something because you think you're going to be disturbing people who will get a 'ping' in the middle of the night or something

very unfortunately, some people probably *do* get pings like that, and it makes me sad ... but given the choice between posting something when i'm in the headspace or waiting until daytime? hours to post, it's better to post (but inform people how to manage their own settings)

some would say my posting these rambles and interrupting flow would be considered poor etiquette, why disturb people with these stupid rambles? (i get that, trust me), but my rebuttal would be that we should have mutable channels and that it shouldn't be interrupting you in the first place ... anyway, lots to be fixed, we'll work it out, but i'm just trying to *reduce friction* for the community ... if someone needs help at 3am and wants to ask a question .... they *should* ... and they should do so knowing it might be 10 hours before they might get a reply, but when they resume 14 hours later they might see one and it can help them then

maybe slack isn't the right forum, and i hate that it's up to the consumers to set up their environments this way, e.g. opt-out, but ... here we are

also, i'm pretty sure that if *i'm* feeling this reluctance to post, based on the behaviour/interpretation of slack, then i'm sure *others (particular the brilliant introverts learning cue at odd hours)* are too, and that bugs me even more ... (edited)

> I think you are right - it is up to each person to configure their do not disturb hours and notifications. Also important is to realise that it isn’t a real time conversation, unless when it actually is, and you have to be polite and let others know that you are going offline, or brb etc.

> Saddest thing are people that show up and ask “Anyone there that can help me with a question?” (without stating the question). Then 10h later there is a “yes, what’s your question?“. So, if you are writing some guidelines to help new slackers, include “Just ask the question!” it is a bit like fishing…
