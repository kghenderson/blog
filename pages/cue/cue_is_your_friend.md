# Why cue's your friend (cooperation over competition)

so ... background, i was thinking more about the playing pool analogy and over a lovely game of table tennis/ping pong yesterday where we agreed to just rally and have fun and not play to compete - there's a time and place for that, of course, but we were playing to make ourselves better, and not to win over the other

and i thought back to many nights playing pool/billiards in bars and what a great way it is to meet people and have a task and learn about each other

it's also an IOI (indication of interest) for people who want to do things with other people, hang out near the pool table, or put your money on the table for next game, and it's an opt-in strategy for camaraderie

leads me to another ramble someday on reddit over facebook, solid & avatars/disposable personas/right to forget, but i'll save that for another time ...

anyway, back to cue ... i was thinking about the docs call and how json was easier and why you'd want to pick one over the other, but it finally dawned on my that .... cue's your friend, it looks after you, cue's cool, it's a bro (in the colloquial sense ofc) ...

but let me explain ... and to be clear i'm talking about the language, and more the cue/command environment sense, not the import this library into your language as a programmer sense ... that case is still evolving

but i think what gets kinda lost or should really be highlighted, is that you cue doesn't make you *choose* and you're not locked in, you can *change your mind* and cue's cool with that

you don't *need* to "pick" between json and yaml and toml or cue whatever ...

json easiest for your python devs to import as dictionaries, cool, cue will help you write json ...

want cue to help you validate json? read json in, validate it, fix it, write json back ... cool, cue will help you do that too

ditto for yaml

like Go? great, it's got you ... write in something else, that's being worked on

where's your data stored? need cue to go get it from some obscure place? cool, cue (and ecosystem of "community" tools) will get it for you ...

shell commands? got you. windows? got you. plan 9.  got you, web service? got you. database, got you.

easier to start someplace else, want to use cue as a stub until you can switch to arrow or parquet or something ... great

cue's an enabler

it's open source, you can use it to make open tools or proprietary ones

need some sample code? cool, cue's got that too, and here, you can use it, no strings

but we're people and represent a cooperative community, so treat kindness in kind, and please support those who support others ...

anyway, i love that with cue i have, not a melting pot, but a fruit salad ( as michael franti says) of config files and formats on my system and a wide variety of people who support and love them for their own reasons

and i have cue tools that read some yaml, that read some environment variables, that work with Make, and read json and call web services, all into a single 'meta' script (cue's the brains in this operation of course) ... and it happy writes back out to those formats as well

cue's a cooperative friend who checks all that for me and works with everyone and ... this is probably a good time to move to the next topic
